# Google-Maps-Project
## How to run the content:
* Download the GitHub .zip files
* Open the terminal and type `cd` followed by a 'space' and then drag the 'Google Maps' folder into the terminal and hit 'Enter'
* Copy & paste (or type): `./node_modules/webpack-dev-server/bin/webpack-dev-server.js` in the terminal and then press 'Enter'.
* When the terminal is done with loading the dev-server, you should see a line at the end that says "webpack: bundle is now VALID."
* Open the web browser and type "localhost:8080" and press 'Enter' and you should see the page load.

### After first load:
After the first time you set up webpack-dev-server and get the localhost:8080 page to load and then close out:
* Open up the OS terminal
* Type `cd` (then press space) and drag the Google Maps folder into the terminal and press 'Enter'
* Then type "webpack-dev-server" in the terminal and press 'Enter'
* You should see the terminal load and activate the server which the last line should read, "webpack: bundle is now VALID."
* Then reload the browser with localhost:8080
